# What I learned

### Chickens01:
- how to use the increment and decrement operators (++, --)
- how to use the shorthand operators (+=, /+, etc.)
- how to make a variable cumulatively add values

### Chickens02:
- whether you should use integer or double data types depending on the variable that we are working with
- whether you should use an integer value or a non-integer value in an expression, depending on the data type of the variable (3 vs 3.0)
- adding the descriptor in the print statement to make the output statement more understandable (system.out.println("Daily Average:   " + dailyAverage);
